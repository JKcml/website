    <p>TLC motorcycles, is a page for genuine enthusiasm and care for classic, custom and vintage motorcycles of any brand, size, type and state. We do not discriminate on the age or performance either. Page for old motorcycles people with passion for them.<br><br>
    The workshop is based in Liverpool and covers its surrounding areas such as Crosby, Southport, Warrington and St Helens.<br><br>
    The page contains all motorcycles I have ever owned. Some I have sold. Some I have crushed and sold. Some I fixed and those I will likely keep once I saw them form inside. Most I still own and probably never sell untill I get to a stage they could not be riden by myself or my family if ever.<br><br>
    My garage is situated in Liverpool, UK. So you can always pop in & check our garage and have a cup of tea. The kettle is always on.<br><br>
    Feel free to call us during normal business hours for any help or advice (07761542802). Or if you would rather email, send us a message to clasicandvintage@buy-swapandsales.com.<br><br>
    And remember that kickstart, analog and carburetor is the best choice every time over injector, ECU and the start button.</p>
